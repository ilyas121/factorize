# Factorize MVP

- Feature Ideas
  - **Log In Page** 
    - Let's ignore this for now, video is good to send 
  - **Video Chat (Epic) / Calendly integration** 
    - Simple mic and video, don't need anything else 
  - **Auto Quoting** - too big of a task right now (need to learn travel time and what not)
    - Demo needs an example part
  - **CAD Viewer**
    - Upload and see CAD step file  
    - Select features (holes for demo) and label them (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    - Give those features notes 
    - Is it ITAR?
